    <p>
        A hearty Italian soup traditionally made with beans, pasta, and lots of vegetables.

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large stockpot over medium-low heat.
                 Sauté garlic in hot oil until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes.
                 Add onion; cook and stir until translucent, 4 to 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Add celery and carrots; sauté for 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>
                Pour in tomato sauce, broth, and water; bring to a boil,
                 stirring frequently. Add red wine; reduce heat to low.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir in zucchinis, spinach, green beans, kidney beans, basil,
                 oregano, salt, and pepper. Simmer until soup is heated through, 30 to 40 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Meanwhile, fill a medium saucepan with water and bring to a boil.
                 Cook seashell pasta in boiling water, stirring occasionally,
                 until tender yet firm to the bite, 7 to 8 minutes. Drain and set aside.

                 Ladle soup over pasta and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.
